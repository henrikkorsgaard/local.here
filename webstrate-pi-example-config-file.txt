#This is an example of a basic configuration file for the webstrate-pi service
#Fill in the information and rename it to .conf in the webstrate-pi dir and it will be used to configure the components for the service
#You can also copy this to the boot partition on the PI sd card (and make it easy to change during setup). Here the file should be called webstrate-pi.conf.
#This file will be used to generate local configurations for the service.
